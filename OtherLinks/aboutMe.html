            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>
                My career journey has been exciting and rewarding. Prior to getting a degree in Game Development, I was an EMT and Navy Corpsman. I have worked on various projects as a student at Full Sail University and am currently developing indie games. Here's a brief overview of my professional experience:
            </p>
            <ul class="career-experience">
                <li>
                    <strong>Active Duty Corpsman - United States Navy (2017-2021)</strong>: During my time on active duty in the Navy, I worked in the Emergency department at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. I worked both in the main side emergency department and in the fast track zone. As a senior Corpsman on the floor, I created educational material and held regular trainings on emergency medicine. I was also assigned to the code team as the lead Corpsman/medic. I was a nationally registered EMT, with certifications in Basic Life Saving, Advanced Life Saving, Pediatric Advanced Life Saving, and advanced electrocardiogram reading.

                <li>
                    <strong>Reserve Corpsman - United States Navy (2021-2023)</strong>: As a reservist, I led funeral details for active duty service members and veterans. I also held trainings for the medical reservists in emergency medicine, TCCC, and electrocardiogram reading. I maintained the medical readiness for the entire Naval reserve center and overlooked clinic supplies. Prior to leaving the Navy Reserve, I earned Sailor of the Quarter at Naval Reserve Center Augusta.

            </p>
            <ul class="hobby-list">
