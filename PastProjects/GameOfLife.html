            <p>Conway's Game of Life is a computer simulation known as a cellular automaton, designed to model complex systems using simple rules on a grid of cells.</p>
            <p>
                This was my first large project at Full Sail University, a solo endeavor in which I fully developed the application. During Project and Portfolio One, I manipulated arrays and data structures within a Windows application to create Conway's Game of Life. This project helped me develop a strong foundation in data manipulation, user interaction, and game design principles.

        <!-- Game Features -->
        <section id="game-features">
            <h3>Game Features</h3>
            <h4>Render Conway's Game of Life in a .NET Application</h4>
            <p>
                The game renders a grid that represents individual cells, which can be toggled on and off by clicking on them with the mouse. Once a group of cells is activated, the game will simulate life and death according to the following rules:
            </p>
            <p>Rule 1: Living cells with fewer than two living neighbors will die in the next generation.</p>
            <p>Rule 2: Living cells with more than three living neighbors will die in the next generation.</p>
            <p>Rule 3: Living cells with two or three living neighbors will survive to the next generation.</p>
            <p>Rule 4: Dead cells with exactly three living neighbors will come to life in the next generation.</p>
            <h4>Tool Strip Buttons</h4>
            <p>
                The game starts running by clicking the **Start** button and can be paused using the **Pause** button. If the game is paused, it can advance by one generation using the **Next** button found on the tool strip.
            </p>
            <h4>Randomizing the Universe</h4>
            <p>
                The universe can be randomly populated either by using the current time or a seed variable. The seed is set via a dialog box, and randomization is activated through a menu selection.
            </p>
            <h4>Emptying the Universe</h4>
            <p>
                The universe is cleared of all living cells when the **New** or **Clear** menu item is selected, allowing for a fresh start or a new configuration.
            </p>
            <h4>Saving and Importing</h4>
            <p>
                The current state and size of the universe can be saved in **PlainText** file format. Users can choose the save file name via a save file dialog box. Additionally, previously saved **PlainText** files can be loaded into the current universe, with the universe resizing to match the size of the file being read.
            </p>
            <h4>Universe Information</h4>
            <p>
                The current generation and number of living cells are tracked and displayed on the status strip at the bottom of the window application, providing real-time information about the simulation's progress.
            </p>
            <h4>Adjustable Options</h4>
            <p>
                The number of milliseconds between new generations can be adjusted through a dialog box. The width and height of the current universe can also be customized via a modal dialog box, allowing users to tailor the simulation to their preferences.
            </p>
            <h4>Cell Information</h4>
            <p>
                The neighbor count for each individual cell is rendered on the grid and can be toggled in the **View** menu, offering insight into each cell's interactions.
            </p>
            <h4>View Menu</h4>
            <p>
                Features such as neighbor count, grid lines, and heads-up display (HUD) can all be toggled on or off in the **View Menu**, allowing users to customize their view of the simulation.
            </p>

            <h4>Importing Patterns</h4>
            <p>
                PlainText life patterns can be downloaded from the **Life Lexicon** website and imported into the current universe. The universe size remains unchanged when importing new patterns, and importing will not clear the universe before reading in the file.
            </p>
            <h4>Game Colors</h4>
            <p>
                Users can select individual colors for the grid, background, and living cells through a modal dialog box, enabling a personalized visual experience.
            </p>
            <h4>Universe Boundary</h4>
            <p>
                Users can choose how the game treats the edges of the universe, with options to switch between toroidal (wrap-around) and finite boundaries.
            </p>
            <h4>Context-Sensitive Menu</h4>
            <p>
                A context menu strip allows users to change various options in the application, providing a convenient way to adjust settings without navigating through complex menus.
            </p>
            <h4>Heads-Up Display (HUD)</h4>
            <p>
                The HUD displays essential information such as cell count, boundary type, and universe size. This feature can be toggled on or off in the **View Menu**.
            </p>
            <h4>Settings</h4>
            <p>
                Changes to universe size, timer interval, and color options persist even after the program is closed and reopened. Users have additional menu items, **Reload** and **Reset**, to revert to the last saved settings or return to the application's default settings.
            </p>
