            <p>In Plain Sight is a stealth-based RPG where the player possesses a random NPC in a medieval village. Your goal is to collect ritual items and perform a cleansing ritual before the entire village falls prey to a demon.</p>
            <p>During the two months of development for this game, I served as the project lead and lead AI programmer. Throughout the project, a total of six developers collaborated on this game. All milestones and deadlines were successfully achieved in a timely manner.</p>

            <h3>Game Features</h3>
            <h4>Villager</h4>
            <p>
                A major feature in this game is the Villager AI. All villagers are possessable by the player. If the AI perceives the player as a threat, they will run to alert the guards. All villagers have daytime and nighttime tasks and jobs, which can include working market stalls, working in the tavern, or residing at their homes.
            </p>
            <h4>Town Guard</h4>
            <p>
                There are two variations of the town guard: melee and ranged. These AI characters can be assigned to a night shift or a day shift. If they are working, they will be out patrolling specific paths or standing guard at designated locations. When not on duty, they can be found in the barracks or tavern. Town guards can also be possessed by the player, which may enable entry into otherwise restricted areas.
            </p>
            <h4>Inquisitor</h4>
            <p>
                The Inquisitor functions similarly to the town guard, except they cannot be possessed. Inquisitors regularly enter the town through a portal, depending on the player’s actions, and are significantly stronger when fighting the player. There is both a melee and ranged variation of the Inquisitor.
            </p>
            <h4>Town Alarm (Bell)</h4>
            <p>
                The Town Alarm notifies an area of a nearby threat. If the bell is ringing, all guards in the area will actively search for the threat, while villagers will retreat to their homes. If an AI detects the player or witnesses a crime and the bell is not ringing, they will run to the nearest town bell to alert the area. The bell will only ring as long as an AI character is nearby ringing it. After the bell stops ringing, there is a cooldown period before normal behavior resumes.
            </p>
            <h4>Day and Night Routines</h4>
            <p>
                All AI characters have day and night routines. During the day, all villagers will be at the markets, praying at the church, in the tavern, or around the town. At night, they will begin returning to their homes. Guards and Inquisitors follow their designated day shift/night shift routines.
            </p>
            <h4>Stealth Mechanics</h4>
            <p>
                This game uses an in-depth stealth mechanic that tracks both individual character anxiety and the global anxiety of an area. Additionally, the player has a fluctuating meter of humanity that determines how monstrous they have become, directly correlating to detection time. AI rely on visual perception when detecting the player. The player is notified if they are seen by AI, indicated by an eyeball icon at the top of the HUD. AI will also consider other environmental factors when determining the player’s detection rate, such as anxiety, global anxiety, alarms, and restricted zones.
