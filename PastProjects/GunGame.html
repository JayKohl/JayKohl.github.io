            <p>Gun Game is inspired by classic arcade games such as Vanguard and Asteroids. Players must try to survive three levels of space combat in hopes of reaching a new high score.</p>
            <p>During this one-month project, I was officially designated as the Graphics Programmer. I was responsible for all graphics rendering using DirectX 11. Additionally, I collaborated with the other three team members to ensure that all assets were rendered correctly, appropriate levels were loaded, menu screens were displayed, and gameplay functionality was implemented effectively. My contributions also included significant work on AI behavior, pathing, AI combat, and player combat.</p>

            <h3>Game Features</h3>
            <h4>Project Overhaul</h4>
            <p>
                During this project, our team was given a test application as a starting point for our game. Within the first week, I removed the rudimentary renderer and replaced the GVulkanSurface API with DirectX 11. I then integrated my level renderer, enabling us to correctly render levels and significantly enhance the game's visual fidelity.
            </p>
            <h4>AI</h4>
            <p>
                AI enemies enter the scene in waves, with two distinct variations present in the game. The first type flies into the scene and begins patrolling a predetermined path while shooting straight ahead. The second type actively seeks out the player and attempts to collide with the player's spaceship. These seeking AI units maintain separation rather than clustering together. I implemented fully functional AI/player collision, accommodating both projectiles and ships. AI can determine the player's direction and adjust their orientation accordingly. Each level features unique AI flight patterns, adding variety and challenge to the gameplay.
            </p>
            <h4>Pausing</h4>
            <p>
                The game includes a seamless pause feature that freezes gameplay while continuing to render graphics correctly. Once the player unpauses, gameplay resumes without disruption, maintaining a smooth and immersive experience.
            </p>
            <h4>Multiple levels</h4>
            <p>
                I rendered three distinct levels for the player to progress through by defeating the required number of enemies. The transition between levels is seamless and efficient, providing a continuous gameplay experience.
            </p>
            <h4>Drops</h4>
            <p>
                Players can collect health drops during levels, which increment their maximum lives by one. These drops offer strategic opportunities to enhance survivability and extend gameplay.
            </p>
            <h4>Menus</h4>
            <p>
                I efficiently and successfully rendered a main menu, win menu, and lose menu, providing intuitive and responsive navigation options for players.
            </p>
