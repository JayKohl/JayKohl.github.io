            <h3>Game Features</h3>
            <h4>Random Level Generator:</h4>
            <p>My random level generator was created using a grid based system. This grid was created by making a node struct that filled a doubly linked list. All paramaters of the generator were made accessable in the Unreal Engine editor for myself and designers to efficiantly tailor each levels paramaters. 
            To use my random level genertor all you need to do is add a blueprint object that has my generator as parent to an empty scene. Then you are ready to run the level. Additionaly if you want to alter level details such as minimum rooms to spawn, maximum rooms to spawn, room size, room types, and syle. 
            All that is needed is to update the variables in the blueprint instance that is found in the respected scene. Additionally the contents of each room is randomized such as enemy spawn, resourse nodes, doors, and lootable chest. these nodes are placeable by a level designer and can easily be made to spawn only 
            desired potential spawns. Designers also have the option to greate further nodes for random generation in rooms in cases such as clutter, additional walls, or obsticles. </p>
            <h4>Mage</h4>
            <p>
                The mage is a unique enemy that is only found in level three dungeons. It is capable of three different attacks. when the player is of melee range to the mage it summons a fire shield that damages the player if they continue
                to stand within it. the second attack is a fire ball that will be shot at the player if they are at a distance. The last attack is a trap; this trap will begin with cracks in the ground to signal the player there is a trap at 
                that location. Then after some amount of time the trap explodes with lava applying damage to the player if they are standing in the errouption. the damage will continue till the player leaves the trap or the trap disapears.
            </p>
            <h4>Summoner</h4>
            <p>
                The summoner enemy has no traditional attacking capabilities. Contrary the summoner relies on its summons to deal damage to the player, these summons require constant focus from the summoner. Two skelletons are able to be 
                summoned. there is an interval that prevents them from being spawned at the same time. If one dies, the summoner will respawn a new skeleton as soon as possible. If the summoner dies so does all of its summons.
            </p>
            <h4>Melee Enemies</h4>
            <p>
