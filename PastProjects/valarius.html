            <p>Valarius is a sci-fi first-person shooter filled with rewarding exploration, fast-paced combat, and dynamic boss fights. </p>
            <p>
                I was the sole AI programmer and team lead for this two-month portfolio project, created using the Unity Game Engine by a team of five developers. We successfully completed all deadlines, milestones, and sprint objectives in a timely manner. Additionally, I fully designed all three game levels.

            <h3>Game Features</h3>
            <h4>Enemy Ai</h4>
            <p>
                Over the course of this two-month project, I developed eight unique enemy AI, along with several variations that utilize the same functionality but with altered stats. AI can be instantiated in a map or triggered to spawn via a spawner. There are two main types of standard enemies that can be encountered: melee and ranged. AI will wander designated areas and only engage the player when the player is detected by that enemy.
            </p>
            <h4>Friendly AI</h4>
            <p>
                Friendly characters can be found in the world to assist the player in completing quests, give the player quests, and, in some instances, interact with the player differently after certain events occur in the world.
            </p>
            <h4>Menu Interface</h4>
            <p>
                I collaborated with team members to develop and design the main menu interface, ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly experience for players.
            </p>
            <h4>Interactable Objects</h4>
            <p>
                I developed terminal computers that can be exploded to unlock otherwise locked doorways within a level. This promotes exploration and encourages player interaction during quests outside of combat.
            </p>
            <h4>Boss Enemies</h4>
            <p>
                The game features three main bosses, with each boss concluding a level. The level one boss is a mech that begins by shooting standard bullets at the player. If the mech's health reaches a critical point, it will start firing rockets at the player. The mech will also activate a life event where it raises a shield and attempts to heal itself if it does not receive damage. The level two boss is a giant bug with multiple melee capabilities, the ability to spawn zombie-like AI, and two different types of projectile attacks. Lastly, the third boss is an advanced alien technology that forces the player to combat waves of various enemies each round. Between rounds, the boss will shoot the player with a special projectile unique to that round. After sustaining enough damage, it will spawn a protective shield and summon more enemies of the respective wave type. This cycle repeats until the enemy is destroyed.
